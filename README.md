# A local rust playground

## These are the coolest ones

* three_body
* flatland_pt
* ants
* particles (though it gets glitchy at high energy and is inefficient with lots of particles due to no acceleration structure)
* skydive (looks pretty, but doesn't actually do what was intended at the moment)
*
