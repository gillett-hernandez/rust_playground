# A local rust playground

## These are the coolest ones

* three_body - has a basic 3d camera and orbit-style camera navigation ~~, though no~~ and panning. controls are middle click to rotate, and R to reset the simulation. [ and ] also adjust a weird adaptive timestep simulation parameter thing.
* flatland_pt
* ants
* particles (though it gets glitchy at high energy and is inefficient with lots of particles due to no acceleration structure)
* skydive (looks pretty, but doesn't actually do what was intended at the moment)
* swarm - currently broken, swarm is too energetic and doesn't coalesce like it should.

## Many others are defunct or WIP that haven't been touched in a while

## Also if there's any data in the `data` folder that I need to take down make an issue or contact me through github
